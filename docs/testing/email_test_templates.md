## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: No notification received

2. Firebase logs show "Push notification sent successfully"
3. Device notification settings enabled
4. App in foreground/background (test both)

**Solution:**
- Verify `users` collection has your userId
- Check `fcmToken` field is populated
- Try closing and reopening app
- Check Android notification permissions

### Issue: Email not processing

**Check:**
1. Firebase Function logs for errors
2. SendGrid webhook configured correctly
3. Email sent to correct address: claims@unshaken-strategy.eu

**Solution:**
- Wait up to 60 seconds (can be slow)
- Check spam folder
- Verify SendGrid MX records
- Try sending again

### Issue: Wrong claim ID extracted

**Check:**
1. Firebase logs for GPT-4 parsed data
2. Claim ID format in email (should be FC-YYYY-XXX)
3. Claim ID mentioned in subject AND body

**Solution:**
- Make claim ID more prominent in email
- Use exact format: FC-2025-001
- Mention "Claim Reference: FC-2025-001"

### Issue: Spam false positive

**Check:**
1. Firebase logs for validation errors
2. Email content for spam keywords

**Spam keywords:**
- viagra, casino, lottery, prince, inheritance

**Solution:**
- Avoid spam keywords in test emails
- Keep email professional and clear
- Use airline-like formatting
