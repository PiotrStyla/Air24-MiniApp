### **Tip Thread (1/5):**
```
🧵 5 things airlines don't want you to know about EU Regulation 261/2004:

1/ If your flight is delayed 3+ hours, you can claim €250-€600

Even if the airline gave you a meal voucher. 
Even if you accepted their apology.
It's your RIGHT under EU law. 💪
```

```
2/ You have up to 6 YEARS to claim (depends on country)

That flight delay from 2020? You can still claim it.
Many people miss out on thousands of euros because they don't know this.
```

```
3/ The airline MUST pay, even if delay was "weather related"

Airlines blame weather for everything.
But if other flights took off, weather wasn't the real reason.
You're still entitled to compensation. ☔→💰
```

```
4/ You can claim even if you booked through third parties

Expedia? Booking.com? Doesn't matter.
Your contract is with the AIRLINE, not the booking site.
You can still claim your compensation. ✅
```

```
5/ Companies like AirHelp take 25-35% commission

For a €600 claim, you pay them €150-200!

Air24 is completely FREE: https://air24.app

Stop paying for your own money. 🚀

### **Professional Launch Post:**
```
🎉 Excited to announce Air24 - Free Flight Compensation Tool

After experiencing the frustration of expensive commission-based services, I built Air24 to democratize access to flight compensation.

**The Problem:**
EU passengers are entitled to €250-€600 for delayed flights under Regulation 261/2004. But services like AirHelp charge 25-35% commission - taking €150-200 from rightful claims.

**The Solution:**
Air24 is 100% free, with features including:
✅ Instant eligibility checker
✅ Automated claim generation  
✅ Real-time tracking
✅ 6-language support
✅ Cross-platform (Web, iOS, Android)

**Who Benefits:**
• Frequent business travelers
• Digital nomads
• Budget-conscious passengers
• Corporate travel managers
• Anyone who values their money

**Tech Stack:**
Built with Flutter and Firebase for seamless cross-platform experience.

### **Case Study Post:**
```
💡 Case Study: How I Validated a SaaS Idea with Zero Budget

Last month I had a problem: flight delayed 5 hours.
Solution exists: EU Regulation 261/2004 (€600 compensation)
But existing services charge 25-35% commission.

So I built Air24 - a free alternative.

**Validation Strategy:**
1️⃣ Surveyed 50 travelers → 80% frustrated with commissions
2️⃣ Built MVP in 2 weeks with Flutter
3️⃣ Soft launch on Reddit → 500 users in 24h
4️⃣ Iterated based on feedback
5️⃣ Official launch on Product Hunt

**Results:**
✅ 1,000+ users in first month
✅ 6-language support
✅ Cross-platform (web/mobile)
✅ 100% free forever

**Key Learning:**
People will love your product if you solve a real pain point and don't charge for it. 😊

**Monetization Plan:**
Exploring freemium model, premium analytics, or B2B partnerships.

Thoughts? How would you monetize this?

### **Thought Leadership:**
```
🤔 Why I Believe in Building Free Tools

Air24 is 100% free. No ads, no premium tier (yet), no hidden costs.

Here's why:

**1. Trust Building**
Free tools build trust faster than paid services.
Users can try without risk.

**2. Market Disruption**
When everyone charges, free = competitive advantage.
AirHelp charges 25%. We charge 0%.

**3. Network Effects**
More users = better product = more users.
Free accelerates this flywheel.

**4. Data & Learning**
Free tier generates usage data for optimization.
Learn what users actually need.

**5. Multiple Monetization Paths**
- Freemium features later
- B2B partnerships
- Premium analytics
- Affiliate opportunities

**The Risk?**
Users might not convert to paid.

**The Reward?**
If you help enough people, opportunities emerge.

Air24 helped 1,000+ passengers claim compensation.
Zero revenue (yet), but infinite goodwill.

Worth it? I think so. 🚀

What's your take on free vs paid strategies?

Title: PSA: You might be owed €600 for that delayed flight

Hey travelers! 

Just a heads up - if you've had an EU flight delayed 3+ hours, you can claim €250-€600 compensation under EC Regulation 261/2004.

I built a free tool to help with this after getting frustrated with services charging 25% commission: air24.app

Works for flights up to 6 years ago (depending on country).

Not trying to promote, just sharing because most people don't know about this regulation!

Happy to answer questions about how it works.
