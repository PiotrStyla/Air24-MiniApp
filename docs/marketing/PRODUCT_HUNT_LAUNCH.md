## 💬 FIRST COMMENT (Post Immediately After Launch!)

**This is CRUCIAL - the first comment sets the tone!**

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Piotr, creator of Air24. Here's why I built this:

**The Problem:**
Last year, my flight was delayed 5 hours. I discovered I could claim €600 under EU Regulation 261/2004. 

But here's the catch: Services like AirHelp take 25-35% commission. For my €600 claim, they'd take €150-200!

**The Solution:**
Air24 is 100% FREE. No commission. No hidden fees.

**What Air24 Does:**
✈️ Checks eligibility instantly
📧 Generates professional claim letters
📊 Tracks claim status in real-time
🌍 Supports 6 languages (EN, ES, PT, FR, DE, PL)
📱 Works on web, iOS, Android

**Who Can Use It:**
- EU flights delayed 3+ hours
- Cancelled flights (less than 14 days notice)
- Denied boarding (overbooking)
- Compensation: €250-€600 depending on distance

**Why Free?**
I believe passengers shouldn't pay 25% commission for their rightful compensation. Air24 empowers people to claim what they deserve.

**Tech Stack:**
- Flutter (cross-platform)
- Firebase (backend)
- Real-time tracking
- Multi-language support

**What's Next:**
- Advanced analytics
- Automated follow-ups
- Mobile app improvements
- More languages

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this more useful? 

Try it out and let me know what you think! 🚀

P.S. - If you've ever had a delayed flight, you might be owed money. Check your eligibility!

- Answer questions thoroughly
- Ask follow-up questions
- Be authentic and helpful

### **Example Replies:**

many EU passengers don't speak English. What language do you need?"
```

```
"Great idea! 💡 I've added this to the roadmap. 
Would you use this feature yourself? How often?"
```

when people are already stressed from flight delays. Have you tried it yet?"
