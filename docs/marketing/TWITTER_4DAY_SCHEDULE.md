## 📅 DAY 2 - THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2025

### ☀️ Morning Post (9:30 AM) - Value Comparison
```
Let's do some math 🧮

Your flight delay claim: €600

AirHelp charges 25% commission:
€600 - €150 (fee) = €450 for you

Air24 charges 0%:
€600 - €0 (fee) = €600 for you

Same claim. €150 difference.

Keep your money: https://air24.app

### 🌤️ Afternoon Post (3:00 PM) - User Story
```
True story:

My flight was delayed 5 hours in 2023.
I was owed €600.

AirHelp wanted €150 commission. 😤

So I built Air24 - a FREE alternative.

Now ANYONE can claim without losing 25%.

Stop paying for your own money.

## 📅 DAY 3 - FRIDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2025

### ☀️ Morning Thread (10:00 AM) - Educational Thread

**Tweet 1/4:**
```
🧵 5 things airlines don't want you to know about EU Regulation 261/2004:

1/ If your flight is delayed 3+ hours, you can claim €250-€600

Even if the airline gave you:
• A meal voucher
• Hotel accommodation  
• An apology

It's your RIGHT under EU law. 💪

👇
```

**Tweet 2/4:**
```
2/ You have up to 6 YEARS to claim (depending on country)

That flight delay from 2020? You can STILL claim it.

Most passengers miss out on thousands because they don't know this.

Air24 makes it easy: https://air24.app
```

**Tweet 3/4:**
```
3/ Airlines blame "extraordinary circumstances" for everything

Weather delay? Check if OTHER flights took off.
Technical issue? Usually NOT extraordinary.
Crew strike? NOT extraordinary.

You're still entitled to compensation! ☔→💰
```

**Tweet 4/4:**
```
4/ You can claim even if you booked through Expedia, Booking.com, etc.

Third-party booking doesn't matter.
Your contract is with the AIRLINE.

You can still claim your compensation. ✅

### 🌤️ Afternoon Post (2:30 PM) - Simple Question
```
Honest question:

Would YOU pay €150 to claim your €600?

That's what AirHelp charges (25% commission).

Air24 is FREE. Keep all €600.

Simple choice.
