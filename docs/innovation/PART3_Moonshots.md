### 7. BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CLAIM NFTs

**Vision:**
Tokenizacja roszczeń lotniczych jako tradeable digital assets.

**Why Blockchain?**
- **Transparency**: Immutable proof of claim ownership
- **Liquidity**: Secondary market for claims trading
- **Fractionalization**: Retail investors can buy portions of claims
- **Global**: Cross-border transactions without banks

---

#### 7A. Claim as NFT

**Concept:**
Each compensation claim = unique NFT on blockchain.

**NFT Metadata:**
```json
{
  "tokenId": "AIR24-CLAIM-0001234",
  "standard": "ERC-721",
  "blockchain": "Polygon",
  "claim": {
    "flight": "FR1234",
    "date": "2025-01-15",
    "route": "WAW-LHR",
    "airline": "Ryanair",
    "legalEntitlement": 400,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "successProbability": 0.68,
    "documentation": ["boarding_pass", "receipts"],
    "status": "pending"
  },
  "owner": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb",
  "created": "2025-01-16T10:00:00Z",
  "ipfsHash": "QmX...",
  "smart_contract": "0x..."
}
```

**Smart Contract Logic:**
```solidity
// ClaimNFT.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract ClaimNFT is ERC721 {
    struct Claim {
        string flightNumber;
        uint256 entitlement;  // in cents (40000 = €400)
        uint8 successProbability;  // 0-100
        bool settled;
        uint256 settledAmount;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Claim) public claims;
    
    function mintClaim(
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        string memory flightNumber,
        uint256 entitlement,
        uint8 successProbability
    ) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        claims[tokenId] = Claim(
            flightNumber,
            entitlement,
            successProbability,
            false,
            0
        );
    }
    
    function settleClaim(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        require(_exists(tokenId), "Claim does not exist");
        claims[tokenId].settled = true;
        claims[tokenId].settledAmount = amount;
        
        // Transfer funds to NFT owner
        address owner = ownerOf(tokenId);
        payable(owner).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

---

#### 7B. Claim Marketplace (DEX for Claims)

**User Journey:**

**Selling a claim:**
```
1. User submits claim → NFT minted
2. List on marketplace: "€400 claim, 68% success, asking €250"
3. Set price (or auction)
4. Buyer purchases with ETH/USDC
5. NFT transfers to buyer
6. Seller receives payment (minus 5% platform fee)
```

**Buying a claim:**
```
1. Browse marketplace: Filter by airline, success rate, price
2. See claim details + AI analysis
3. Make offer or buy instantly
4. NFT transfers to your wallet
5. You own the claim rights
6. Track status on-chain
7. Receive payout when settled
```

**Marketplace UI:**
```dart
class ClaimMarketplace extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GridView.builder(
      itemCount: availableClaims.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        final claim = availableClaims[index];
        
        return ClaimNFTCard(
          tokenId: claim.tokenId,
          flight: '${claim.airline} ${claim.flightNumber}',
          route: claim.route,
          entitlement: '€${claim.entitlement}',
          askingPrice: '€${claim.askingPrice}',
          discount: '${((1 - claim.askingPrice/claim.entitlement) * 100).toInt()}%',
          successProb: '${(claim.successProbability * 100).toInt()}%',
          daysToSettle: claim.estimatedDays,
          roi: '${((claim.entitlement / claim.askingPrice - 1) * 100).toInt()}%',
          onTap: () => showClaimDetails(claim),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

**Example listings:**
```
🎫 RYANAIR FR1234 WAW→LHR

#### 7C. Fractionalized Claims

**Innovation:**
Split one €400 claim into 100 shares @ €4 each.

**Why?**
- **Lower barrier**: Retail investors with €10 can participate
- **Diversification**: Buy 10 shares across 10 different claims
- **Liquidity**: Easier to trade smaller amounts

**Implementation:**
```solidity
// FractionalClaimNFT.sol
contract FractionalClaimNFT is ERC1155 {
    struct FractionalClaim {
        uint256 parentClaimId;
        uint256 totalShares;
        uint256 pricePerShare;  // in wei
        mapping(address => uint256) shareholders;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => FractionalClaim) public fractionalClaims;
    
    function fractionalize(
        uint256 claimId,
        uint256 totalShares,
        uint256 pricePerShare
    ) public {
        // Burn original NFT
        // Mint fractional shares
        _mint(msg.sender, claimId, totalShares, "");
        
        fractionalClaims[claimId] = FractionalClaim(
            claimId,
            totalShares,
            pricePerShare
        );
    }
    
    function buyShares(uint256 claimId, uint256 amount) public payable {
        uint256 cost = fractionalClaims[claimId].pricePerShare * amount;
        require(msg.value >= cost, "Insufficient payment");
        
        // Transfer shares
        _safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            msg.sender,
            claimId,
            amount,
            ""
        );
    }
    
    function settleProportional(uint256 claimId, uint256 totalPayout) public {
        // Distribute payout proportionally to all shareholders
        uint256 payoutPerShare = totalPayout / fractionalClaims[claimId].totalShares;
        
        // Iterate shareholders and pay
        // ...
    }
}
```

**UI for fractionalized claims:**
```
🎫 PORTFOLIO CLAIM #42
Total value: €2,000 (5 claims × €400)
Your shares: 125 / 500 (25%)
Investment: €500
Expected payout: €500 + 60% ROI = €800
Time horizon: 45 days avg
Risk level: Medium

Individual claims in portfolio:
- FR1234: €400, 68% prob → Your share: 25% = €100
- W62345: €400, 75% prob → Your share: 25% = €100
- U21234: €400, 60% prob → Your share: 25% = €100
- LH4567: €400, 82% prob → Your share: 25% = €100  
- EW9876: €400, 71% prob → Your share: 25% = €100

#### 7D. Staking & Yield Farming

**Concept:**
Lock your ETH/USDC to fund claim purchases, earn yield.

**How it works:**
```
1. Users stake USDC in liquidity pool
2. Pool funds used to buy claims at discount (e.g., €250 for €400 claim)
3. Claims settled → Pool receives €400
4. Profit (€150) distributed to stakers
5. APY: 30-50% (high risk, high reward)
```

**Smart Contract:**
```solidity
contract ClaimStakingPool {
    IERC20 public usdc;
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakes;
    uint256 public totalStaked;
    uint256 public totalReturns;
    
    function stake(uint256 amount) public {
        usdc.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        stakes[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalStaked += amount;
    }
    
    function buyClaim(uint256 claimId, uint256 price) public onlyOwner {
        // Use pooled funds to buy claim NFT
        claimNFT.transferFrom(seller, address(this), claimId);
        usdc.transfer(seller, price);
    }
    
    function settleClaim(uint256 claimId, uint256 payout) public onlyOwner {
        totalReturns += payout;
        
        // Distribute proportionally to stakers
        // APY calculation, etc.
    }
    
    function withdraw() public {
        uint256 userStake = stakes[msg.sender];
        uint256 userShare = (userStake * totalReturns) / totalStaked;
        
        usdc.transfer(msg.sender, userStake + userShare);
        stakes[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

### 8. AI-POWERED CLASS ACTION ORGANIZER

**Vision:**
Automatically detect mass incidents and organize collective lawsuits.

**Problem:**
When airline cancels 50 flights in one day, 5,000 passengers affected but each fights alone.

**Solution:**
AI detects patterns, auto-organizes class action, leverages collective power.

---

#### How it works:

**Step 1: Mass Incident Detection**
```python
# Real-time monitoring
class MassIncidentDetector:
    def monitor_flights(self):
        # Check AviationStack API every 15 min
        flights = self.api.get_all_flights()
        
        # Group by airline + date
        incidents = self.group_by_airline_date(flights)
        
        # Detect anomalies
        for airline, date, flight_list in incidents:
            if len(flight_list) > 30:  # >30 cancelled flights
                self.trigger_class_action_alert(airline, date, flight_list)
    
    def trigger_class_action_alert(self, airline, date, flights):
        # Calculate affected passengers
        affected_count = sum([f.passenger_count for f in flights])
        
        # Calculate total compensation
        total_comp = sum([f.compensation for f in flights])
        
        if affected_count > 1000 and total_comp > 300000:  # €300k+
            self.create_class_action(airline, date, flights)
```

**Step 2: Auto-notify Affected Users**
```
Push notification:
"🚨 MASS CANCELLATION ALERT
Ryanair cancelled 47 flights on 2025-02-15
5,200 passengers affected
Potential €2.1M in compensation

JOIN CLASS ACTION:
- Strength in numbers
- Shared legal costs
- Higher success rate (95% vs 60%)
- Faster resolution

```

**Step 3: Class Action Dashboard**
```dart
class ClassActionScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final ClassAction action;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Header
        Text('Class Action vs ${action.airline}', style: heroStyle),
        Text('${action.affectedCount} passengers'),
        
        // Progress bar
        LinearProgressIndicator(
          value: action.joinedCount / action.minRequired,
          label: '${action.joinedCount} / ${action.minRequired} joined',
        ),
        
        // Stats
        Row(
          children: [
            StatCard(
              title: 'Total Compensation',
              value: '€${action.totalCompensation}',
            ),
            StatCard(
              title: 'Your Share',
              value: '€${action.yourCompensation}',
            ),
            StatCard(
              title: 'Success Rate',
              value: '${action.successRate}%',
            ),
          ],
        ),
        
        // Benefits
        Text('Why join:'),
        BenefitItem(icon: Icons.people, text: 'Collective bargaining power'),
        BenefitItem(icon: Icons.gavel, text: 'Top lawyers representing us'),
        BenefitItem(icon: Icons.speed, text: '3x faster resolution'),
        BenefitItem(icon: Icons.money, text: 'No upfront costs'),
        
        // Join button
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => joinClassAction(action),
          child: Text('Join Class Action (FREE)'),
        ),
        
        // Timeline
        Timeline(
          steps: [
            'Gathering plaintiffs (${action.joinedCount}/1000)',
            'Lawyer consultation',
            'File lawsuit',
            'Negotiate settlement',
            'Receive payout',
          ],
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**Step 4: Lawyer Coordination**
```python
class ClassActionCoordinator:
    def organize_legal_action(self, action: ClassAction):
        # Find specialized lawyer
        lawyer = self.lawyer_network.find_best_match(
            country=action.country,
            specialty='aviation_law',
            class_action_experience=True,
        )
        
        # Calculate economics
        total_comp = action.total_compensation  # e.g., €2M
        our_fee = 0.25  # 25%
        lawyer_cost = 50000  # Flat fee for class action
        expected_profit = (total_comp * our_fee) - lawyer_cost
        # €500k - €50k = €450k profit
        
        if expected_profit > 100000:  # Worthwhile
            lawyer.file_class_action(action)
```

---

#### Economics:

**Example scenario:**
```
Incident: Ryanair cancels 50 flights
Affected: 5,000 passengers
Compensation: €400 each = €2,000,000 total

Class action:
- Lawyer fee: €50,000 (flat)
- Platform fee: 15% of settlement
- Settlement: €1,800,000 (90% of claim)

Distribution:
- Passengers: €1,530,000 (€306 each)
- Platform: €270,000 (€1.8M × 15%)
- Lawyer: €50,000
- Net profit: €220,000

ROI for passengers:
- Individual claim: €400 × 60% success = €240 expected
- Class action: €306 guaranteed = 27% more!
```

class InsuranceCheckout extends StatelessWidget {
  final Flight flight;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Flight details
        FlightCard(flight: flight),
        
        // Insurance upsell
        Card(
          color: Colors.blue[50],
          child: Column(
            children: [
              Icon(Icons.shield, size: 64),
              Text('Protect your trip', style: headlineStyle),

              Row(
                children: [
                  Icon(Icons.check, color: Colors.green),

              ),
              
              // Social proof
              Text('4,247 travelers protected this week'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

#### Business Model:

**Actuarial Math:**
```python
# Calculate profitability
def calculate_insurance_premium():
    # Historical data
    delay_rate = 0.08  # 8% of flights delayed >3h
    avg_payout = 200  # €200 per claim
    
    # Expected loss per policy
    expected_loss = delay_rate * avg_payout
    # 0.08 × €200 = €16
    
    # Add buffer (30%) + operating costs (20%)
    premium = expected_loss * 1.5
    # €16 × 1.5 = €24
    
    # But we price at €3.99!
    # How? ML underwriting + diversification
    
    # ML model predicts actual risk per flight:
    # - Ryanair WAW-LHR in winter = 15% risk → charge €5.99
    # - Lufthansa FRA-MUC in summer = 3% risk → charge €2.99
    
    # Portfolio approach:
    # - 1000 policies sold @ €3.99 = €3,990 revenue
    # - 80 claims (8%) × €200 = €16,000 payouts
    # - Net: -€12,010 LOSS!
    
    # BUT with ML:
    # - 500 high-risk @ €5.99 = €2,995
    # - 500 low-risk @ €2.99 = €1,495
    # - Total revenue: €4,490
    # - Expected claims: (500 × 0.15 + 500 × 0.03) × €200 = €18,000
    # - Still loss? NO! Because:
    
    # Secret sauce: We ALREADY OWN claims!
    # - User pays €3.99 for insurance
    # - Flight delays → We pay user €200
    # - We ALSO pursue airline for €400 EU261
    # - Net: -€200 + €400 = +€200 profit per claim!
    
    return {
        'premium': 3.99,
        'expected_loss': 16,
        'expected_recovery': 400 * 0.70,  # 70% success rate
        'net_profit': (400 * 0.70) - 200 - 16,  # €64 per policy!
    }
```

**Revenue Projection:**
```
Year 1:
- 50,000 policies sold
- Avg premium: €4.99
- Revenue: €249,500
- Claims paid: €160,000 (3,200 claims @ €50 avg cost to us)
- EU261 recovery: €560,000 (70% success)
- Net profit: €649,500

Year 2 (scale):
- 500,000 policies
- Revenue: €2.5M
- Net profit: €6.5M
```

### 10. UX/UI MOONSHOTS

#### 10A. Conversational AI Interface

**Voice-first experience:**
```
User: "Hey Air24, my flight was delayed"
AI: "I'm sorry to hear that. Which flight?"
User: "Ryanair 1234 from Warsaw"
