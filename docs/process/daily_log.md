**Metrics:**
- DAU: [Analytics collecting data - 24-48hr delay for Firebase Console]
- Claims: 81+ test claims submitted today
- Premium: 0
- MRR: â‚¬0

**Learnings:**
- Firebase DebugView only works in debug mode (not production/web)
- Analytics events ARE being sent despite no DebugView data
- Production analytics data appears in Firebase Console after 24-48 hours
- Email ingestion backend requires manual Firebase Functions deployment
- GPT-4 can effectively parse airline email responses
- Firebase environment config uses `firebase functions:config:set`

**Blockers:**
- Firebase Functions not yet deployed (pending manual deployment)
- SendGrid inbound email webhook not configured
- Analytics DebugView shows no events (expected for production mode)

**Tomorrow (Day 5):**
- [ ] Deploy Firebase Functions to production
- [ ] Set up SendGrid inbound parse webhook
- [ ] Test email ingestion end-to-end
- [ ] Check Firebase Console for analytics data (if 24hrs elapsed)

**Notes:**
Major infrastructure day! Email ingestion backend complete, analytics enhanced, Firebase dashboards live. Analytics IS working (events being sent), just can't see in DebugView due to production mode. Focus tomorrow on deploying Functions and testing email flow! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š

## 2025-10-06 (Day 5) ðŸ”„

**Completed:**
- [x] Firebase Functions directory created with complete email ingestion code
- [x] Dependencies installed (firebase-admin, openai, @sendgrid/mail)
- [x] Firebase Functions code complete (ingestEmail + healthCheck endpoints)
- [x] firebase.json configured for Functions deployment
- [x] .firebaserc created with project configuration
- [x] Deployment guide written (docs/deployment/firebase_functions_deployment.md)
- [x] API keys documented and attempted to set
- [x] All code committed to GitHub (3 commits today)

**Metrics:**
- DAU: [Checking Firebase Console for Day 4 data]
- Claims: 81+ (from Day 4 testing)
- Premium: 0
- MRR: â‚¬0

**Learnings:**
- Firebase CLI can have silent failures (no output in terminal)
- Missing .firebaserc causes deployment to fail silently
- firebase.json must include "functions" configuration
- npm install -g firebase-tools may need troubleshooting
- Functions can be deployed via Firebase Console UI as alternative
- Code readiness â‰  deployment success (tooling matters!)

**Blockers:**
- Firebase CLI not showing any output (tried multiple times)
- Functions deployment blocked by CLI issue
- firebase deploy --only functions runs but shows no output
- Even firebase --version shows nothing
- SendGrid webhook config pending successful deployment

**Next Session:**
- [ ] Troubleshoot Firebase CLI or use Console UI deployment
- [ ] Deploy Functions to production (manual if needed)
- [ ] Configure SendGrid inbound parse webhook
- [ ] Test email ingestion end-to-end
- [ ] Verify analytics data in Firebase Console

**Notes:**
Productive infrastructure session! All Firebase Functions code complete and ready for deployment. Hit Firebase CLI tooling issues - commands run but show no output. All code safely committed to Git. Functions can be deployed via Firebase Console UI as workaround. Focus next session: deploy Functions and test email flow! ðŸš€

**Time Investment:** ~2 hours (Functions setup + CLI troubleshooting)
